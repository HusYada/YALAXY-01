# YALAXY-01

This is a rather ambitious project I'll be working on for the next few weeks and months, here's what I've got so far; it's going to be a "boss-rush" style game but so far it's just a square-circle here :P, the code's all messy with if's too, gotta clean that up later!

Controls:
Left & Right - Movement
Hold Down then Left or Right - Quick Teleport
A - Fire
B - Slash
L & R - Cycle Colours

Thanks:
Butano - very very cool engine
Tonc - also very veyr cool
All the other technical stuff and people that made the good things - you're a real cool person
